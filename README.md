Getting starting with docker project
- First of All, What is Docker ? Docker is a tool that enables us put our applications into containers, in other word it's a containerization platform .
- Why it is used and why do we need it? in production environment, sometimes we face some problems: the application doesn't work propebly and this can be due to dependencies, librairies and versions, framework,... etc that we have in our environment but not in the production environment. So we need a standartized way to package the app with it's dependencies and be able to deploy it in any environment and here comes Docker, a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy and run applications by using containers.
- How does Docker work ? Docker packages an application and all it's dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any server. Each container runs as an isolated process in the user space and take up less space than regular VMs due to thier layeres architecture.
- What is a container ? A container allows to package all the app dependencies. It containes everything needed to run the app.
